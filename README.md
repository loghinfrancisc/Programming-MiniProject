# Programming-MiniProject (TIC-TAC-TOE)

This is a server & client TCP based project on the classic game, "Tic-Tac-Toe"

# Rules

The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game. This game supports up to 4 players with the remaining players waiting in the game lobby for their turn

# How to play

First off, you need a java based IDE to be able to open the project files. One of the players must host the server, from there on the remaining players needs to run the client project. Once two players are connected the game will start.
